# SmallTalk
Small Talk Informal Language Learning App

##App Design:

* The SmallTalk platform has three parts: an API and a web-based UI for mobile phones, and a content management system for lesson plans.
* SmallTalk is written using Microsoft ASP.Net as a backend with a responsive HTML5 frontend using AngularJS and Bootstrap.
* SmallTalk is designed to run mainly on smartphones.  The prototype is web-based, but a native app can talk to the same API.
* This database diagram shows the things the SmallTalk tracks:
